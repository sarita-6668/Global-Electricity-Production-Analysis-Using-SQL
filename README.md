Using SQL, the project uncovers insights into energy production patterns, highlighting the shift from traditional to renewable sources and the nations driving clean energy adoption.

Objectives
Analyze the growth of renewable energy production over the past decade.
Determine the share of energy sources in total electricity production by country.
Identify countries with significant shifts toward renewable energy.
Compare global trends in energy production.
Highlight leading countries in clean energy transitions.
Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset on electricity production. It includes information on energy generation from different sources such as coal, gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, oil, wind, bioenergy, and other renewables across multiple years and countries.

Business Questions & Insights
1. Countries with the Highest Growth in Renewable Energy
Over the last decade, several countries have significantly increased their renewable electricity production. The analysis highlights nations that have made the most progress in wind, solar, hydro, and bioenergy generation.

2. Energy Source Distribution by Country
For the most recent year in the dataset, the proportion of each energy source in total electricity production was analyzed. This provides insights into the reliance on traditional vs. renewable energy sources in different nations.

3. Year with the Highest Global Nuclear Energy Production
The analysis identifies the year in which nuclear energy production peaked worldwide, showing trends in the use of nuclear power over time.

4. Countries with Declining Electricity Production Despite Global Growth
While global electricity production has generally increased, some countries have experienced periods of decline. These cases were identified to understand the reasons behind such trends.

5. Countries with the Largest Variation in Natural Gas Production
The study highlights the top five countries with the biggest difference between their minimum and maximum electricity production from natural gas, reflecting changes in energy policies and resources.

6. First Country to Generate Solar Energy
The first country to produce electricity from solar energy and the year it happened were identified, showcasing early adoption of solar technology.

7. Countries Producing More Renewable Energy Than Coal in 2023
For the year 2023, countries where electricity production from renewable sources exceeded coal-based production were examined, demonstrating a shift towards cleaner energy.

8. Countries Producing Twice as Much Renewable Energy as Coal in the Last Decade
The analysis identifies countries that, over the past 10 years, have generated at least twice as much electricity from renewable sources compared to coal.

9. Dominant Energy Source in Each Country (Coal vs. Renewables)
For the entire dataset period (1965â€“2023), the dominant energy source in each country was determined, highlighting whether coal or renewable sources were more prevalent.

10. Countries Producing Over 60% of Their Electricity from Renewables in the Last Decade
The analysis reveals nations where renewable energy sources accounted for more than 60% of total electricity production in the last 10 years.

Key Takeaways
âœ… Renewable Energy Growth is Accelerating: Many countries have significantly increased their renewable energy production in the past decade, with wind and solar leading the transition.

âœ… Coal Dependence is Declining, But Not Eliminated: Some countries still rely on coal, but a growing number have surpassed coal production with renewable sources.

âœ… Global Nuclear Production Has Fluctuated: While nuclear power remains a key energy source, its production has varied due to policy changes and energy demand shifts.

âœ… Energy Transitions Vary by Region: Developed nations are leading in renewables, while developing countries still face infrastructure and policy challenges in making the shift.

âœ… The First Movers in Solar Energy: Early adopters of solar energy paved the way for broader adoption, demonstrating the potential of sustainable energy.

âœ… Some Countries Have Faced Declines in Energy Production: Despite global growth in electricity production, certain nations have seen declines, indicating economic or policy-driven shifts.

âœ… More Countries are Reaching 60%+ Renewable Share: Several nations now generate over 60% of their electricity from renewables, showing that large-scale clean energy transitions are achievable.

Findings & Conclusion
Growth in Renewables: Many countries have made significant progress in increasing electricity production from renewable sources in the last decade, with some leading in wind, solar, and hydroelectric power generation.
Energy Distribution: Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and bioenergy have become a major component of global electricity production, surpassing traditional sources like coal and oil in some nations.
Challenges & Opportunities: While many countries are moving toward cleaner energy, some still rely heavily on fossil fuels. This presents challenges but also opportunities for global energy policies and investments in renewables.
